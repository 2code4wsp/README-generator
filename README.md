# README-generator

## Description
Every repository needs a README file in order to describe a detailed overview of the project written. This generator will save time and effort to allow any coder to generate a professional README with ease. Allow this template to create your next README file by simply answering each question when prompted. The program will then generate your answers in the correct format.

## Installation
do I need to say that node.js and inquirer8.2.4 needs to be installed? 

## Usage
ADD screenshots here, and video

## Credits
I had a tutoring session with Ms. Yates to help me create and understand the markdowns. I had help with the if statement for the MIT license and used that as my template to create the rest.
