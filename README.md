# README-generator

## Description
Every repository needs a README file in order to describe a detailed overview of the project written. This generator will save time and effort to allow any coder to generate a professional README with ease. Allow this template to create your next README file by simply answering each question when prompted. The program will then generate your answers in the correct format.

## Installation
 Node.js will need to be installed (for this project I have version 16 of Node.js) on your machine and then you will install inquirer by typing "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" in the integrated terminal. At this point you may run "node index" and answer the prompts as they appear. 

## Usage


## Credits
I had a tutoring session to help me create and understand the markdowns. I had help with the if statement for the MIT license and used that as my template to create the rest for link, badge, and section.
